# Docker Theory

## Notes from Webinar

**Kubernetes**

- Lots of new job roles
- Developed by google
	- Now open source
- Self healing
- Auto scaling and load balancing
- Can set autoscaling
	- Maximum and minmum pod number set

**Adopting micro services**

- start small, use iterations
- use docker/kubernetes to test and self heal

**Docker and Kuberntes**

- Docker creates containers
- Kubernetes manages them
- Togethor are transformation enablers and tools


## Docker Theory

```docker ps```

- Checks container running
- ```-a``` Shows all containers running

```docker pull```

- Gets image from docker hub

```docker run```

- Runs from docker hub
- With -p e.g. below will run from local container

```docker rm 34e90b4095ba -f```

- Removes container

**For more commands see setup in README**
