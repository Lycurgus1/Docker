# Docker Repositry

- Wider Docker theory is discussed in Theory.md
- For a basic Docker setup see below
	- This applies to systems with windows operating system
- Once docker has been basically set-up there is follow up files for automating container setup

## Dependencies

- Git bash - download here
```https://gitforwindows.org/```

## Docker Intro Steps

### Step 1 
- Install docker

- Follow the steps here

```https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/```

- If getting errors see possible troublshooting steps below

### Step 2
- Check Docker Installed

```
docker --version
```
- May need to up it

```
docker up
```

### Step 3
- Work with image

```
docker pull nginx # This pulls the image from docker hub
docker images # Will show images downloaded. Should show nginx
docker run ahskhan/nginx-test-rp-app
```

### Step 4 

- Run docker image

```docker run -p 80:80 ahskhan/nginx-test-rp-app:v2```

- In browser the below should show nginx home page
- 80:80 is port mapping. Mapping to Nginx local host

```localhost```

### Step 5

- Remove container. Based on docker id (the misc string). -f to force.

```
docker rm 34e90b4095ba -f
docker ps # Confirms change
```

### Step 6

- Run server in seperate app. "-d" Illustrates this

```
docker run -d -p 80:80 ahskhan/nginx-test-rp-app:v2
```

### Step 7

- Enter container

```
alias docker="winpty docker"
docker exec -it 090eeef9fee3 sh
```
- You are now inside nginx container. Has linux container
- Type ```exit``` to exit

### Step 8

- Create docker hub
- First create an account at
```https://hub.docker.com/```

### Step 9

- Push to docker hub

```
docker login -u max476
docker tag 4bb46517cac3 max476/max-docker-first:firstcommit
docker push max476/max-docker-first:firstcommit
```

### Step 10

- Once this is done follow ```AUTOMATION_SETUP.md``` to connect the sparta node app to mongo

## Docker Errors 

![Error](images/HyperVError.PNG)

- Make sure Hyper V Enabled
	- Done via turn windows features on/off
	- May be neccessary to disable, restart then enable again
- Uninstall and reinstall Docker
- Go into BIOS and make sure virtulisation is enabled
	- There is several links online, see below for one
